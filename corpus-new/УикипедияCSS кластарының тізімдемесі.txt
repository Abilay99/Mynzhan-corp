There are a lot of CSS classes and IDs used on the English Wikipedia. The use of most of them is not clearly explained or described anywhere but on the place they are used. However, since Special:Whatlinkshere does not work for CSS, it can be hard to find these explanations; the definitions themselves can be located in many different places. This page is an attempt to catalogue and describe all the CSS classes and IDs used on this wiki. There is still a lot of classes and IDs to document, add some! Also add information about other skins. Internet Explorer is a bit more buggy than other popular browsers, and needs some additional CSS and JavaScript to work around some of its bugs. The body of a page has as class name the pagename with spaces and colons replaced by underscores, and prefixed with "page-", e.g. this page's body has class page-Wikipedia_Catalogue_of_CSS_classes. i.e. interface buttons, links, etc.
