Әдебиет саласы бойынша Нобель сыйлығы (швед. Nobelpriset i litteratur) — жыл сайын әдебиет саласы бойынша Нобель қорынан берілетін сыйлық. 1895 жылдың  27 қарашасында Париж қаласында Альфред Нобельдің өзі 5 сала бойынша Нобель сыйлығы берілуі керектігін айтқан. Соның ішінде әдебиет саласы да болған. Әдебиет саласы бойынша Нобель сыйлығы 1901 жылдан бастап беріледі. Осы күнге дейін жалпы 106 сыйлық берілген. Нобель сыйлығы тарихында бұл сала бойынша тек 7 рет қана берілмеген (олар 1914, 1918, 1935, 1940-1943 жылдары). Ең алғаш 1901-ші жылғы Нобель сыйлығының иегері француз поэты, әрі эссе жазушысы Сюлли-Прюдом болған. 2014 жылы Нобель сыйлығының иегері атағын француз жазушысы Патрик Модиано ұтып алды. Нобель сыйлығының берілу тарихында 4 рет сыйлық 2 иегерге ғана берілген, олар сыйлықты 1904, 1917, 1966 және 1974 жылдары жеңіп алған. Тұрақты Швед академиясының хатшысы Петер Энглундтың пікірі бойынша "сыйлықты жеңіп алу жазушының талантына тікелей байланысты".  1901 және 2014 жылғы сыйлық иегерлерінің орташа жасы 65 жасқа тең. Ең жас әдебиет саласы бойынша Нобель сыйлығының иегері Редьярд Киплинг саналады, ол 1907 жылы 42 жасында сыйлық иегері атанды, ең егдесі Дорис Лессинг, ол сыйлыққа 88 жасында ие болды.

Қазіргі уақытта ресми сайтта тек 1950 жылға дейінгі қатысушылар туралы ғана толыққанды мәлімет берілген.
